### About the project
Handwriting recognition is a computer’s ability to recognize and interpret handwritten input. It’s sometimes known as handwritten text recognition.
The focus of this project is to further survey the task of classifying handwritten text and to convert handwritten text into digital format. In this project, we took on the challenge of classifying the image of any handwritten word, which might be in the form of cursive or block writing.
